Python implementation of an agent-based model based on Social Sampling Theory (Brown et al., 2018) with visualization scripts to explore agent behavior and polarization dynamics.

The repository includes model.py for running the agent-based model, output.json containing model results, and visualization.py to explore and plot the simulation data.
